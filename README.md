* ISBN-10 ‏ : ‎ 1133109098
* * ISBN-13 ‏ : ‎ 978-1133109099
  * * Author: James Shipman; Jerry D Wilson; Aaron Todd
   
  * Consistent with previous editions of An Introduction to Physical Science, the goal of the new Thirteenth edition is to stimulate students' interest in and gain knowledge of the physical sciences. Presenting content in such a way that students develop the critical reasoning and problem-solving skills that are needed in an ever-changing technological world, the authors emphasize fundamental concepts as they progress through the five divisions of physical sciences: physics, chemistry, astronomy, meteorology, and geology. Ideal for a non-science majors course, topics are treated both descriptively and quantitatively, providing instructors the flexibility to emphasize an approach that works best for their students.
